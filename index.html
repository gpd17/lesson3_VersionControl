            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is “ a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time that you can recall specific versions later” (Git Fast Version Control). Not only can you undo your changes, but you can compare changes, as well as see who makes the changes. Furthermore, Version Control is a way for you to go back, look at changes, and see why you did them in the first place. In other words, version control is a way to keep records and history of your work. The nice thing about Version Control is, it can be used on pretty much all computers. </p>

                </span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">One of the advantages of using a VCS is being able to understand why a change or edit was made to a file or document. Being a web developer , we are constantly editing and going back to the original, then editing again, and sometimes we don’t even remember why we made it change. This why using VCS is advantage for developers. If you don’t understand why you made a change something, you can always revert back to the original file. Another advantage of using a VCS is collaboration. Although, collaboration can be difficult a type of VCS was created to help with this issue. It is called a Controlled Version Control System (CVCS). The nice thing about this type of VCS is that everyone on the project knows  what everyone else is doing.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are many git commands. Some of these git commands include commit, push, and clone. These commands and their usages are listed below. 
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Git commit-</strong> This type of command (git commit m) commits any files you have added and changed. </li>
            <li><strong>Git push- </strong>The git push command sends changes to the remote repository. </li>
            <li><strong>Git clone-</strong> A git clone does exactly what it sounds like it would do. It makes a copy of the local repository.</li>
            </ul>
 
Some other git commands include the following: pull, remote, status, add, init. Again, there are other git commands, but these are just a few. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">If you want to you know the state a file is in, use the git status command tool. There are a couple of states your files could be in. One of them include having a clean working directory. Typically, you will see a clean working directory after you clone a file. When you see a clean working directory, it means that none of the files that have been tracked have been edited. Another purpose of the git status command tool is to tell you which branch you’re on. It also lets you know whether or not that branch has diverged from the same branch on the server. </p>
